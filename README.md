# Spam-email-classifier
## Scope of the Project: 
This project develops an automated spam detection system using a Naïve Bayes classifier. It encompasses:
1.	Email Preprocessing: Cleans email data by removing irrelevant elements and normalizes text using NLP techniques like tokenization, stop word removal, and stemming.
2.	Feature Engineering: Converts text into numerical representations (e.g., TF-IDF) and extracts meaningful features like keyword frequencies.
3.	Model Implementation: Trains and deploys a Naïve Bayes model for spam classification, chosen for its efficiency and suitability for text-based tasks.
4.	Performance Optimization: Focuses on achieving high accuracy while minimizing false positives and negatives.
5.	User Interface: Deploys a real-time detection system via a Streamlit-based user interface, enhancing usability and transparency.
